This program implement the maximum spacing k-clustering algorithm.
For an introduction, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering

Usage: big_k_clustering filename
The format is:
[# of nodes] [# of bits for each node's label]
[first bit of node 1] ... [last bit of node 1]
[first bit of node 2] ... [last bit of node 2]
...
For example, the third line of the file "0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1" denotes the 24 bits associated with node #2.

The distance between two nodes u and v in this problem is defined as the Hamming distance--- the number of differing bits --- between the two nodes' labels. For example, the Hamming distance between the 24-bit label of node #2 above and the label "0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1" is 3 (since they differ in the 3rd, 7th, and 21st bits).

The program returns the largest value of k such that there is a k-clustering with spacing at least 3.
